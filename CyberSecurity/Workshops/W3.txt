W3a: Nmap

What does the switch -A do?
Found the OS, version detection, script scannin and traceroute

What does the switch -T4 do?
Does faster execution by limiting the time on specific ports

a. enter command "nmap -A -T4 localhost"
b.Review results
which ports and services are opened?
ports: 21, 22, 23, 80
services:ftp, ssh, telnet, http

for each of the open ports, record the software that is providing the services
ftp - vsftpd 2.0.8
ssh - openssh 7.4
telnet - Openwall GNU/*/Linux telnetd
http - nginx/1.12.0

what is the operating system
Linux

W3b: Wireshark Topology
sudo ~/lab.support.files/scripts/cyberops_topo.py
xterm H1; ifconfig
xterm H2; ifconfig

H1: IP address = 10.0.0.11 MAC Address = 0e:a2:82:c6:40:fe
H2: IP address = 10.0.0.12 MAC Address = ba:9d:19:dc:17:c6

xterm H1; wireshark-gtk &; hit start; back to H1; ping -c 5 10.0.0.12; hit stop
type icmp in wireshark filter and apply;
Click first PDU, then go to middle section;

Does Source MAC match H1's interface? Yes same MAC
Does the Destination MAC address in Wireshark match H2’s MAC address? Yes same MAC

xterm H4; ifconfig
xterm R1; ifconfig

H4: IP address = 172.16.0.40 MAC Address = 4a:d7:be:17:14:77
R1-eth1: IP address = 10.0.0.1 MAC Address = 4a:75:be:f4:06:07
R1-eth2: IP address = 172.16.0.1 MAC Address = 8a:95:f2:ef:7e:e4

New wireshark on H1: capture > start, start, Ctrl-E
ping -c 5 172.16.0.40

Destination IP and MAC Address - request:
IP - 172.16.0.40 (H4)
MAC - 4a:75:be:f4:06:07 (R1)

quit mininet: quit
cleanup : sudo mn -c

W3c: Wireshark ethernet frames
What is significant about the contents of the destination address field?
It is a broadcast so it was sent out to all devices on the network not just one
Why does the PC send out a broadcast ARP prior to sending the first ping request?
This is to discover where the device is so that the data isn't sent aorund to every user
What is the MAC address of the source in the first frame?
f4:8c:50:62:62:6d
What is the Vendor ID (OUI) of the Source’s NIC?
f4:8c:50
What portion of the MAC address is the OUI?
The first six hex numbers
What is the Source’s NIC serial number?
62:62:6d


xterm H3; ifconfig
H3: IP address = 10.0.0.13 MAC Address = b2:46:19:18:c9:85
What is the IP address of the default gateway for the host H3? 10.0.0.1
arp -n; arp -d IP-address
What is the MAC address of the PC’s NIC? b2:46:19:18:c9:85
What is the default gateway’s MAC address? ba:31:bb:e5:43:6c
What type of frame is displayed? IPv4


Rest of workshop is basically trying to show you that the MAC Address changes
depending on if it has to go through other devices (e.g.router) to get there

Wireshark does not display the preamble field of a frame header. 
What does the preamble contain?
