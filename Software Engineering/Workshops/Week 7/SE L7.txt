Software Reuse:
    Has been focussed on original developments
    Better cheaper and efficient code when reused
    Major shift towards this in last 10-15 years
    Accidental reuse - using something for a task they weren't designed for
    Planned reuse - Reusable components are built e.g. Code libraries, API's etc
    Application reuse - whole app can be reused
    Components reuse - Pieces can be reused
    Object/Function reuse - single, well defined object or function can be reused
    Benefits - Dependability, Time, Reduced Risk
    Problems - Maintenance costs, NIMBY
