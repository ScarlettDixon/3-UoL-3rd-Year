Convert photons to electrons
convert electrons to voltage to binary

Digitisation
Sampling and quantization
Sampling - lay a grid over an image, turn into matrix, 
	smallest element from discretization is pixel
	for 3-d element is called a voxel
	gives spatial resolution
Quantization - a discetization of the intesnity values
	smallest change in intensity
	gives intensity resolution
	
DPI and PPI
Sampling usually not uniform, uses adaptive aswell
Image Interpolation
Resolution change - zoom, distort, rotate, repair
using known data to estimate unkown values
Nearest neighbour
Bilinear 
bicubic
basics-spines
