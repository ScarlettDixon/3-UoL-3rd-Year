# 3-UoL-3rd-Year
Code and other information from the third year of a BSc Computer Science degree at the University of Lincoln.

Student ID: 16602092 

**Modules Taken:**

Algorithms for Data Mining - Manipulating large amounts of data to attempt to find significance and displayable characteristics within. Use of Pandas and Jupyter for plotting.
Assignments and workshops included. 
Assignment 1 involved developing both a ridge regression and a k-means clustering algorithm.
Assignment 2 took nuclear reactor data and once imported it was up to students to choose and then develop an algorithm to adequetely show the data.

---
Autonomous Mobile Robotics - An incredibly interesting module of the course where students were given access to robots using the ROS Middleware and taught how sensors and software can be combined to give a robot functionality. 
Assignment included navigating a room to find coloured poles and mapping said room using different techniques.
 
---
Cyber Security in Society - This module was taught to help with understanding challenges faced by society and industry in the cyber security field, understanding the types of attacks and mitigations.
Assignment included that asked students to discuss a data breach within an airline company and discussing the possible causes and future improvements that could be made

---
Image Processing - Students were taught further about the manipulation of images, this time using Matlab to tackle zooming, smoothing and shape isolation among other techniques.
Assignment and workshops included.
Assignment involved using techniques learnt to complete a series of tasks on multiple different images. 

---
Parallel Computing - Using previously learnt coding knowledge, the step was taken to use OpenCl to develop code that would run on parallel systems, while also discussing what types of code can't be parallelised due to the nature of their function.
Assignment and workshops included.
Assignment was to take two weather datasets, one much larger than the other (the smaller being used for testing), and use a graphics card's parallel proceessing to analyse them and produce meaningful information (Mean weather, weather in a certain location etc).

---
Software Engineering - To fully prepare us for how corporate structures work and the development of projects, we were introduced to a number of design strategies including waterfall, scrum and other agile processes.  
Assignment and workshops included.
Assignment was given to developing a system that interacted with a Movie Rating API and could be used to give meaningful data back. The process involved developing the artifact from conception to completion using the SCRUM process

---
Project - The final project for the course. When writing the dissertation research was undertaken to ascertain the landscape we would be developing out artifact for. In the case of my own project, research was done into current algorithms for anonymisation and deanonymisation of data. It was found that there was not sufficient teaching of the higher level concepts distilled down to those not within the cyber field, thus the idea of developing a system for companies to anonymise their data then attempt to de-anonymise it to ensure security was undertaken.
