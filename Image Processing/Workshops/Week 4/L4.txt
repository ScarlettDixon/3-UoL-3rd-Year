Gamma Correction - A Power-law response phenomenon
Intensity Slicing - Highlighting a specific range of intensities 
Low contrast histogram - narrow and centered on the middle of the gray scale
Thresholding function - creates binary image

Spatial Filtering
	original image plus a filter mask
	Process consists of moving filter mask from pixel to pixel
	response of filter calculated using a predefined relationship
	predefined relationship - linear or non-linear
	linear - sum of products of filter coefficients and corresponding image pixels
	mean of a neighbourhood
	How to deal with edges? cropping, zero padding, extending, wrapping
	
	
Gaussian Smoothing
	Smoothing based on alpha
	
Order Statistic Filtering
	Order the array
	Calculate max, min, median and mode
	Used in deep learning
